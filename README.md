# Huffman-Coding

Problem Statment:
You are required to write a program that can compress
and decompress text files using Huffman encoding.

## Input to this program is:
1. A file name.
2. Whether to compress or decompress the file.

## Output of the program is:
1. The compressed/decompressed file.
2. The code used to code the bytes of the source file.
3. The compression ratio.
4. The execution time.

## Part (A) â€“ Compression 
(>>>huffman.py)
You must build the Huffman tree andassign a Huffman code 
for each character. Your output is the compressed file,
compression ratio and the codes used to compress the file.

## Part (B) - Decompression 
(>>>huffman.py)
You must read the file header and then the file must then
be decompressed (returned to its original format).


## Part (C) - Compression and decompression of folders
(>>>huffman_multiple_files_not_tested_v1.py or \_v2.py)
You must read folder with files in it compress and remove them,
then decompress them back to their original state.
